# @openota/sdk

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Sync the published packages with OpenOTA Cloud, which has moved well past what 0.1.0 knew about:
  - `@openota/cli`: `login`/`init`/`doctor` for Cloud project auth, `--release-notes` on `release`/`upload`, `--reason` on `rollback`, credentials stored outside `openota.config.json`.
  - `@openota/sdk`: `OTA.configure()` accepts `projectId` and `channel` to route through the project-scoped Cloud endpoints; sends an anonymous device ID so check-ins are attributable; reports install/failure/rollback outcomes back to the server for Analytics.
  - `@openota/shared`: type/schema updates backing the above (channels, install-result status, project-scoped response shapes).

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @openota/shared@0.1.1
